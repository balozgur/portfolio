# Ozgur Balbay - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

I am a person with an engineering background, enthusiastic to explore and loves practical as well as theory. After what I learned in my working life and the process of discovering myself, I started to look for a new field and after about two years of research, I started working on Data Analytics. 

The purpose of my sharing here is to draw a roadmap, to convey what I have learned from another perspective, and to present my skills to you. 

Hi, i'm Ozgur! I'm trying to find my own best.
